In order to follow the subsystem convention of accessing online monitoring
calibration constants from files in a subdir rather than the db, this directory
was created and populated with Fcal online monitoring "Pre" reference values.

The macro which was used to create them is checked into cvs:
offline/packages/fcl/macros/fcalMonAnal.C

In addition, a Pdbcal table was added and the calibrations committed to the
DB with the macro:
offline/packages/fcl/macros/commitCbCFcalPreMonitoring.C

A dead channel map is added to this directory as well.  The 'dead channels' 
are identified in the gain calibration tables in the database by negative
gain values.  Currently there are 5 on the North and 1 on the South.  The format
of the dead channel file is:
[side] [col] [row]
