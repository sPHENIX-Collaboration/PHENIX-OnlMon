These are the scripts which need to run on the machine which runs
the monitoring etpool.
etpool:        /etc/rc.d/init.d
start_et.csh:  /etc
stop_et.sh:    /etc

This crontab entry will remove unused stations from the et pool. They tend to 
pile up when monitors crash. It is not critical to clena them up immediately 
but if their number exceeds a given maximum no new monitor can connect to the 
et pool.
